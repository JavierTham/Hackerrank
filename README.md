Trying to start coding regularly (in python)

Have been dealing with a lot of Java and R due to modules this past semester. Thus, getting a little rusty in Python. Have to also start preparing for technical interviews :D 

_Disclaimer: time and space complexity for some of the code may not be the best, give me advice pls D:_
